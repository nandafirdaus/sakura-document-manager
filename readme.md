## Sakura Document Manager

This is a document information system create for my father's company, Sakura Dewata Tour and Travel. This project is built using Laravel Framework with MySQL. The main function of this project is for managing travel and work document of Sakura's client and give reminder if the document will be expired soon so Sakura team could alert the client to renew their document. Hence, they will not penalized for being late to renew their document.

This system also used to manage the document and reduce the need for hard copy document. It allows Sakura team to add, edit, delete, search, and download their client's document easily. Last but not least, it will produce some reports about the status of their client's working and travel document.
